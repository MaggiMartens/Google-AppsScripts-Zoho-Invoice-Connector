# Google-AppsScripts-Zoho-Invoice-Connector

This script provides a simple way to regularly pull data from Zoho Invoice into a Google Spreadsheet for further analysis. It's initially configured for the items endpoint, but can be easily adapted to work with time entries, projects, and other Zoho Invoice endpoints.

  2. Generate a refresh token via an API call.

#### Step 2: Configure the Script

1. Open the script and locate the `CONFIG` object at the beginning.
2. Insert the Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token obtained in Step 1.
   - **Security Note**: Ensure restricted access to the script, as it contains sensitive information.

#### Step 3: Run the Script

1. Execute the script to start fetching data from Zoho Invoice.

#### Step 4: Schedule Automatic Runs (Optional)

1. Use the Google Apps Script UI to set up triggers and schedule recurrences for the script.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

This script was developed as a quick utility and does not include comprehensive error handling. If you encounter issues, especially during HTTP calls, consider adding custom log entries for debugging. Enhancements to error handling may be added in future iterations. You can ask for help in the issues section but i'm not sure that i can answer in time. Sorry!
